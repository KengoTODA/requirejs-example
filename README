# simple sample project about shim config
The new `shim config` supports to define dependency between javascript.
see: https://github.com/jrburke/requirejs/wiki/Upgrading-to-RequireJS-2.0

## what this example do
- loading `main.js` from `index.html`
- `main.js` depends on `basic.plugin.js`
- `basic.plugin.js` depends on `basic.js`
- so `basic.js` should be loaded at first.

requirejs.config in `main.js` define dependency between `basic.plugin.js` and `basic.js` by using `shim config`.
